# 🎮 Tic-Tac-Toe

Welcome to the **Tic-Tac-Toe** game! This project features a modern and sleek UI, with two gameplay modes: **Play against AI** and **Play with a Friend**. The game is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, offering a responsive and interactive experience.

## ✨ Features

- 🎲 **Single-Player Mode**: Play against an unbeatable AI using the **Minimax algorithm** with heuristics to ensure optimal and fast decisions.
- 👥 **Two-Player Mode**: Play with a friend and track player names.
- 🖼️ **Dynamic UI**: Modern, responsive design with hover effects and animations.
- 🎉 **Endgame Popup**: Displays the result of the game (win, lose, or draw) in a stylish popup with a restart option.
- 🔄 **Reset and Home Navigation**: Easily reset the board without losing initial selections or navigate back to the home screen.

## 🤖 Algorithm

The game leverages the **Minimax algorithm** for its AI in single-player mode. The Minimax algorithm is a recursive strategy used in decision-making and game theory. It ensures that the AI makes optimal moves by simulating all possible game outcomes, minimizing the possible loss in a worst-case scenario. 

To speed up the decision-making process, **heuristics** are applied to prune unnecessary branches in the decision tree, making the AI fast and efficient.
